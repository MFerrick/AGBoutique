Website for **fictional** clothing boutique

Located in Charleston, SC, Authentic Grace's target clientele is comprised of women, largely mothers, in their late 20s to late 40s, looking for reasonably-priced, but stylish, clothing that is easy to care for.

I initially created this MVP (minus the item.html page) with a partner for a project for Moms Can Code School. The intention was to create a site for the store so they can expand their reach by allowing new and existing customers to view and purchase online, as well connect to the store's fashion and style blog. I later added item.html to showcase one particular item.

The current active pages on the site are as follows:

- Homepage
- Dresses & Rompers
- Contact Us
- Social media icons link to site homepages

Wishlist elements to add:
- Working shopping cart
- Comments/review section on item page
